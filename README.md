IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project
Introduction To Capstone Project
You have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, your organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. 

As a Data Analyst, you will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. 

Your first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources, including:

   - Job postings

   - Training portals

   - Surveys

Once you have collected enough data, you will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:

   - What are the top programming languages in demand?

   - What are the top database skills in demand?

   - What are the popular IDEs?

You will begin by scraping internet websites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases.   
 
Once completed, you will prepare that data for analysis using data-wrangling techniques. 
 
When the data is ready, you will want to apply statistical techniques to analyze it. Then, you will combine all of your information by using IBM Cognos Analytics to create your dashboard. Finally, you will share your findings in a presentation to show off your storytelling skills.

You will be evaluated using quizzes in each module and the final project presentation.
